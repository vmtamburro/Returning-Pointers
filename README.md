# Returning-Pointers
This is a program that I created for my CSE lab that accepts an array, and array size as an argument and returns a pointer to an altered array. The first array reverses the array. The second array doubles the size of the array and initializes the remaining values to 0. The last array initializes the first value to 0, and shifts all other values one to the right.
